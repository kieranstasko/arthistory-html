# arthistory.html
This project was created in 2020 as a part of my HS Digital Web Design class.
The purpose of this project was to create a custom art gallery, with information available behind a link contained in each picture.
Note- this project is not currently being hosted. The original view of the website has not been preserved due to the css not linking with the raw files. To best view this, input the code into a self-contained html viewer.
